## What I learnt
* **Hidden Files:** Files and directories that start with a dot (`.`) are hidden from standard directory listings.
* **The `ls -a` Command:** The **`-a`** (for "all") option for the `ls` command reveals these hidden files, allowing you to find the password stored inside the `inhere` directory.
